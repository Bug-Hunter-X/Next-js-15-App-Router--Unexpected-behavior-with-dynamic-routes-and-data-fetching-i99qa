# Next.js 15 App Router: Unexpected behavior with dynamic routes and data fetching

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in Next.js 15's App Router when using dynamic routes and data fetching.  The issue involves inconsistent data rendering based on the route segment, which is not expected based on current Next.js documentation and best practices.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/` and `/1`. Notice the discrepancy in the behavior of the data fetching and rendering.

## Expected Behavior

Based on the understanding of the App Router, the data fetching should behave consistently, regardless of the dynamic route segment.  The `id` variable should be populated correctly in both cases.

## Actual Behavior

The data fetching works correctly in `/1`, but in `/` the `id` variable is not populated correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Additional Context

This issue might be linked to how Next.js handles default values or dynamic route matching in the App Router.  Please investigate and provide a solution or workaround if possible.
